# jsboard
JavaScript library for board games.
<br><br>
jsboard allows you to focus on your game logic, game AI, and game algorithms rather than focusing on creating and styling your game using HTML and CSS. jsboard allows you to create and play 2D board games very easily using its functions so you don't have to worry about how to represent your game in JavaScript or how to display it in the HTML. 

# The Basics
All you need to get started is a simple HTML file and a JS file where your game code will go. Here's what you need in your HTML file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<table id='game'></table>
<script src="jsboard.min.js"></script>
<script src="examples/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
